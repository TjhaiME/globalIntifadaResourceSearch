#ogTitle and ogDescript are empty, were replaced with og_title and og_description

#functions.py is duplicated to not have to deal with python import from parent folders,
    this is only done for a script that converts terminal relative file names to code file relative file names
    more experienced python developers will be able to find a more elegant solution

#same as the data folder which has been duplicated inside the flask folder

#the search is pretty sucky. How to make better:
1) better user summaries, make a consistent format that works well and doesnt dilute meaning
2) We could make three seperate vector embeddings for the userSummary and the ogDescription as well
    as the url + og_title + tags. Then choose how much we want to contribute from each one.
3) We could use a bigger LLM model that understands semantics better
4) We could train an LLM on Palestine related words, perhaps start with confliBert or something already trained on similar words.
5) we could add keyword search and weight it with vector similarity search
6) make seperate weightings or search functions for short and long search prompts, 
    which seem to perform quite differently in many LLM based search apps.

#problems with seperate models:
    we would need to make all embeddings again, the search embedding model must match the data embedding model.
