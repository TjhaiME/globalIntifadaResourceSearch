the dataset was initially obtaineds manually from tech4Palestine discord/useful resources
inside uncleanedData folder

it was then categorised and placed into chatGPT to turn into a python dictionary 
with url as key and value as a dictionary with userSummary and a category tag
into summary.py
at the bottom of summary.py is code to run to turn it into a json
using code in getURLSnippet.py to get the og_description and og_title or any errors

(TODO: moreToAdd.py is filled with links that needed more work fist)

I then run makeEmbeddings.py to use Distilbert to make vector embeddings for combioned text and
save into another json

Then we can use search.py to search for a static prompt we put in the code as a variable,
or we can use the flask application...


python intifadaResources/flask/app.py
will run a search application to search through the resources with natural language
It runs on localHost with the AI hosted locally, shouldn't be too hard to convert to a website
