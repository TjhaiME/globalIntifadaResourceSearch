#Resource Compiling Tools

Many of us and the projects we're contributing to have similar processes in terms of needing to collect and store information, videos, screenshots etc. Wondering if there is a shared resource that can help with recommendations or best practices? 
For example:

- Recommended list of URL archiving sites (wayback machine, archive.is, etc)
- Tools or process for screenshots, social media grabs
- Tools for quick video capture, editing, or subtitling/translation

You can buy esims for Palestinians in Gaza that they can use to contact the world including emergency services and family members, including when Israel cuts off the connection etc. I've done this and can see them being used https://www.instagram.com/p/C1cY1DftOsZ/?igsh=aDRwdWQyaGpmemVq

You can help Palestinian students who are stuck without family in Jordan and without a way to pay their student bills, eg. breadwinning family member was in west bank and fired after oct 7 or killed in genocide https://www.instagram.com/p/C1cY1DftOsZ/?igsh=aDRwdWQyaGpmemVq

Today I had a meeting with the team of StandwithPalestine from tech for palestine and they were amaaazing I was amazed with what these young boys and girls from egypt have achieved and how they have put out their work together through their website.
I feel like a proud mum hhh although I just met them today
This gives me so much hope in our future generations:
I invite you all to support their great project through all their social media platforms and to invite all your network to do so

Hello, here is an effective site on palestine and the conflict, in the form of a Q&A https://decolonizepalestine.com/faq/. It does not look like it has been updated for recent events, though. Can be a resource or model for some of the proposals for information/education sites.

Visualizing Palestine is doing an awesome job
https://www.visualizingpalestine.org/


https://gaza23.com/
This is to document the systematic genocide & massacres
done by the Zionist occupation against Gaza civilians, women & children

would you know where they got thier documentation from?
probably:
- t.me/eyeonpal
- Motaz, Bisan & other journalists in Gaza
This is the creator of this project and would love to get in touch with him as I know others who are working on collecting Palestine materials before and after 2023.
https://t.co/BeaFYdausl





Hi, I created a page with a banner that shows some statistics about the war of Gaza, find it here: https://stand-with-palestine.pages.dev/



Hi everyone, new here but have created a few resources that people might be interested in.

- Style guide (what language I'm using when I write about Palestine and why): https://open.substack.com/pub/staystrongtrueheart/p/style-guide-for-palestine?r=2z5po2&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web
- Films for Palestine (almost all are free, and most are available via streaming): https://open.substack.com/pub/staystrongtrueheart/p/style-guide-for-palestine?r=2z5po2&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web
- Tidal Playlist for Palestine: https://tidal.com/browse/playlist/345b2b41-823b-4265-bad6-84744d263d2a
- YouTube playlist for Palestine: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQ8a4Jm--XzJrL3ZgItIQ3yefmcB6evmR&feature=shared





A new initiative HEAL Palestine: https://mailchi.mp/adfdc72628e9/heal-palestine
HEALTH EDUCATION AID LEADERSHIP organisation


A place to immediately deploy resources and/or promote going forward: https://palestinelegal.org/ takes on retaliation cases where people advocating for a free palestine are punished for their speech. Most notable was Ryna Workman (https://theintercept.com/2023/10/16/pro-palestine-students-campus-gaza-war/) .  Lowering the risk of retaliation means more people willing to say more things in more ways.









Not about tech, but a great site to share stories/poems/letters for the children of Palestine: https://islamophobia.io/palestine. Though it is backed by tech and she can probably use help.






There is a 'resources' doc with resources, as to adding to website i have no idea, i think its a good idea maybe in https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BEu7zm1-lCVY6s9_33LjjUiT5ybB0E0yHOwC_e8ihWo/edit#gid=2142279523 (NO ACCESS)

##HISTORIC RESEARCH and legal stuff:

https://www.commondreams.org/news/israel-south-africa-genocide


in 2022 the US, UK and others signed the Political Declaration on Strengthening the Protection of Civilians from the Humanitarian Consequences Arising from the Use of Explosive Weapons in Populated Areas, which is obviously very relevant to Gaza but I haven't heard it mentioned before https://international-review.icrc.org/articles/the-2022-political-declaration-on-the-use-of-explosive-weapons-in-populated-areas-924



So this is the research notes I took from the book "the ethnic cleansing of Palestine". This file will be amazing for someone that writes content, wants to learn more about certain characters or events or someone that reads the book. This file include an analysis of :
- brief introduction about all the characters and their context in the book as quotes
- Places of Palestinian villages and what happened to it
- brief introduction of historic events
- Others may include references, book names or events that are not related to the main topic
you can access the research notes either by **PDF version **or downloading the main notes app I took the notes from which is **Obsidian**
***IT'S COMPLETELY FREE***




Very detailed and properly sourced account by Israeli historian Lee Mordechai (Hebrew University): "As I hope to have demonstrated through the evidence above, the situation in Gaza is a horrible catastrophe that continues to unfold daily in front of our eyes. The least I can do is to gather the evidence and speak up now." Here: https://www.academia.edu/112967602/My_testimony_regarding_the_Israel_Gaza_war_updated_to_15_March_2024_?auto=download




Really interesting legal POV on the West Bank sanctions Executive Order:
>>By providing financial, material, or technological support for, or goods or services to any person or entity blocked by this order, they can be sanctioned themselves.
That includes foreign persons who are CEOs, board directors, or other corporate or governmental officials of entities whose members have engaged in these actions, even if the CEO or the entity itself didn’t directly engage in these actions. 
https://legallyunconventional.substack.com/p/hey-fill-in-the-blank?open=false





Book suggestion , written in 1978! Summary:  Choice quote: “A small group of fascists gangsters essentially hijacked a religion” https://liberatedtexts.com/reviews/zionism-as-a-fascist-ideology-zionist-relations-with-nazi-germany-by-faris-glubb/





I couldn't find the project 7th Oct fact checker, but here a lecture from Azmi Bishara Lecture on Politics, Ethics, and International Law in the War on Gaza. In this lecture Azmi mentioned 8 pages of isrealis propaganda that was debinked. I sent them an email to get these pages  
https://www.dohainstitute.org/en/Events/azmi-bishara-lecture-the-war-on-gaza-politics-ethics-and-international-law/Pages/index.aspx
https://www.dohainstitute.org/en/Lists/ACRPS-PDFDocumentLibrary/azmi-bishara-lecture-the-war-on-gaza-politics-ethics-and-international-law-en.pdf





A very interesting finding. **UN General Assembly Resolution 3379** was adopted in 1975 but was revoked in 1991!.
UN General Assembly Resolution: ' Determines that Zionism is a form of racism and racial discrimination'
This resolution was revoked by Bush Administration in 1991... UN General Assembly should ADOPT this back...

https://www.hrw.org/report/2023/12/21/metas-broken-promises/systemic-censorship-palestine-content-instagram-and - I feel like this resource from Human Rights Watch is very useful as it relates to censorship and content moderation. Also very relevant for anything tech <> Palestine.




In the 1930s, Zionists collaborated with the Nazis to deport people to Palestine. Everyone, please read the scholarly works.
https://www.euppublishing.com/doi/abs/10.3366/hls.2014.0089?journalCode=hls
https://www.jstor.org/stable/2536016
Knowledge is power. Spread the Facts.






This is a very good resource, It covers almost everything about what anyone without any background needs to know about occupation of Palestine https://pragmaticlyabstract.medium.com/unraveling-israel-palestine-conflict-cd5782e67cc3

#LISCENSING OSS FOR PALESTINE:
Since some of us here are in the OSS space, I think it's important to consider alternative Licenses. Licensing conversations have always been contentious but at the end of the day I am of the opinion that if Licensing conventions & norms can be desecrated for the commercial interests of the *founding* maintainers then it can also be adjusted to be in line with the views and values of the maintainers.
Maybe i'm just imagining this but I recall a major maintainer of OpenCV (?) leaving the project because it was being widely used for mass surveillance.
As such, many OSS projects are used for nefarious projects. For example ardupilot being used as the brains behind the Sniper Drones being used against children - I'm sure there's some OpenCV & visual detection libraries in there also.
With my own project, I noticed a lot of Israeli developers wanting to use it for their real estate projects. This concerned me as I didn't want my work to be used in what's most likely the process of selling real estate on occupied terroritories.
This is why I looked into alternative licensing for my project; after much research I mashed up Hippocratic & Do No Harm Licenses and added restrictions relating specifically to settler colonialism & apartheid.
Here's the license I came up with:
https://github.com/open-wa/wa-automate-nodejs/blob/master/LICENSE.md
and since then the Do No Harm people have added a BDS module to their custom license builder.
https://firstdonoharm.dev/build/?modules=bds#bds
Licensing is like dungeons and dragons lore in that it never really gets enforced in the real world but it may give some piece of mind to maintainers that their work is not being used to further suffering.
