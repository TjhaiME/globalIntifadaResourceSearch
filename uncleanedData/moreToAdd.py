Hey <@372757388740132874>, there’s a slew of great boycott apps available, like:
* boycat
* boycottasone
* boycotzionism       (one T)
* disoccupied 
* no thanks 
*... and at least 2 more whose names I forgot*
Always check ‘product of/made in’ info, and (to be safe) stay away from UPCs starting with     729     841     871     … they’re is’r’helli
