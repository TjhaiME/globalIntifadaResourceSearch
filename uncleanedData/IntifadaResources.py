# Hi, not sure where best to post this. Many of us and the projects we're contributing to have similar processes in terms of needing to collect and store information, videos, screenshots etc. Wondering if there is a shared resource that can help with recommendations or best practices? 
# For example:

# - Recommended list of URL archiving sites (wayback machine, archive.is, etc)
# - Tools or process for screenshots, social media grabs
# - Tools for quick video capture, editing, or subtitling/translation

# Maybe we can collate something ourselves. We could post these specific questions, get responses from the community here, and then collate into a doc.

# https://www.gazamediaresources.com/ is a collection of advice and resources put out by experienced human rights evidence collectors














# Was going through this, and unfortunately the first 4 resources ([Law for Palestine](https://law4palestine.org/law-for-palestine-releases-database-with-500-instances-of-israeli-incitement-to-genocide-continuously-updated/), [Institute for Palestine Studies](https://www.palestine-studies.org/en/node/1654922), [Israel massacres](https://israel-massacres.com/), [Hasbara tracker](https://hasbaratracker.com/)) have not been updated since early this year, at the latest (so only document *a few months of a year-long genocide*), while [Criminals Among Us](https://www.criminalsamongus.com/) and [Monsters Among Us](https://monstersamongus.org/) are down. 

# Does anyone know of alternative sources for contributing/analysing this data?

# If not, there might be a need for a similar project, though it'd be helpful to find out what obstacles led to the previous ones stalling.

# If we are talking about doing something, please send this to your local media, draw attention to it on your social media, request influencers plug it as well, send it to Congress members, MPs, all party leaders, and ensure it gets as much public outage and condemnation for inaction that it deserves.  Media and social media is the only way to do that.

# Those with technical capabilities need to ensure it floods every channel out there for vitality.  If you have the abilities to do that and have talent from a digital marketing perspective, bring it guys.  There are letters for the US, Canada and the UK, the core contingents of English speaking Western civilization and culture.  Share across the border with friends and family that can bring their time, and across the pond with all the influencers and digital momentum builders and people you can think of.

# Please download the letters and send them directly as well as sharing the site.  The letters contain excellent details that can also serve as an important resource

# Is there a thread for socials of people specifically in Rafah to follow?  I saw a few recs recently in the general channel but not all of the folks are in Gaza.  With Al Jazeera being banned, and other media outlets facing the possibility of the same, it seems following socials of people in Rafah is crucial right now.  Israel doesn't want the world to see what they're doing!  I'm not on social media, so I don't know accounts to follow other than ones everyone knows like Bisan.  Maybe we could start compiling recommendations in a thread in this channel though, and just note what languages the poster tends to use?

# I've made an ongoing thread of attacks on aid-seekers on Twitter. Each are paired with relevant reports (mainly Qudsnen), the date, injured and death count of the attack. To increase the reliability of the information in the thread, I've also begun adding additional sources for the attacks (mainly from Al Jazeera and Wafa). The project is on halt right now due to some personal reasons so if you can, feel free to contribute by adding additional sources (preferably from AJ or Wafa) and adding attacks I might've missed (I believe there are at least 2 ive missed since the project stopped)

# - brief introduction about all the characters and their context in the book as quotes
# - Places of Palestinian villages and what happened to it
# - brief introduction of historic events
# - Others may include references, book names or events that are not related to the main topic

# Wanted to surface this extraordinary database: https://littlesis.org/ It is a database of powerful and rich figures throughout the world, their network, and their donations.

# From the website:
# > We bring transparency to influential social networks by tracking the key relationships of politicians, business leaders, lobbyists, financiers, and their affiliated institutions. We help answer questions such as:
# > 
# >     Who do the wealthiest Americans donate their money to?
# >     Where did White House officials work before they were appointed?
# >     Which lobbyists are married to politicians? Who do they lobby for?
# > 
# > All of this information is public, but scattered. We bring it together in one place. Our data derives from government filings, news articles, and other reputable sources. Some data sets are updated automatically; the rest is filled in by our user community

# For example, here is the data for Andreessen Horowitz (https://littlesis.org/entities/41946-Andreessen_Horowitz) and DCVC (https://littlesis.org/entities/440012-DCVC)

# Since some of us here are in the OSS space, I think it's important to consider alternative Licenses. Licensing conversations have always been contentious but at the end of the day I am of the opinion that if Licensing conventions & norms can be desecrated for the commercial interests of the *founding* maintainers then it can also be adjusted to be in line with the views and values of the maintainers.

# Maybe i'm just imagining this but I recall a major maintainer of OpenCV (?) leaving the project because it was being widely used for mass surveillance.

# As such, many OSS projects are used for nefarious projects. For example ardupilot being used as the brains behind the Sniper Drones being used against children - I'm sure there's some OpenCV & visual detection libraries in there also.

# With my own project, I noticed a lot of Israeli developers wanting to use it for their real estate projects. This concerned me as I didn't want my work to be used in what's most likely the process of selling real estate on occupied terroritories.

# This is why I looked into alternative licensing for my project; after much research I mashed up Hippocratic & Do No Harm Licenses and added restrictions relating specifically to settler colonialism & apartheid.

# Here's the license I came up with:
# https://github.com/open-wa/wa-automate-nodejs/blob/master/LICENSE.md

# and since then the Do No Harm people have added a BDS module to their custom license builder.

# https://firstdonoharm.dev/build/?modules=bds#bds

# Licensing is like dungeons and dragons lore in that it never really gets enforced in the real world but it may give some piece of mind to maintainers that their work is not being used to further suffering.









# A place to immediately deploy resources and/or promote going forward: https://palestinelegal.org/ takes on retaliation cases where people advocating for a free palestine are punished for their speech. Most notable was Ryna Workman (https://theintercept.com/2023/10/16/pro-palestine-students-campus-gaza-war/) .  Lowering the risk of retaliation means more people willing to say more things in more ways.
