# The Accountability Archive is a crowdsourced record of journalists, politicians, and public figures endorsing or encouraging the ethnic cleansing of Gaza and/or defaming pro-Palestinian activists.



# I've made an ongoing thread of attacks on aid-seekers on Twitter. Each are paired with relevant reports (mainly Qudsnen), the date, injured and death count of the attack. To increase the reliability of the information in the thread, I've also begun adding additional sources for the attacks (mainly from Al Jazeera and Wafa). The project is on halt right now due to some personal reasons so if you can, feel free to contribute by adding additional sources (preferably from AJ or Wafa) and adding attacks I might've missed (I believe there are at least 2 ive missed since the project stopped)
